Steps to Acquiring Demo Coins
Follow the steps below to acquire demo coins for testing purposes:

# IMPORTANT: THIS PROCESS SHOULD ONLY BE DONE ON A COMPUTER!

Ensure that you are in MetaMask. Confirm this by visiting the following link:

As shown, I currently have 0.48 ETHEREUM test coins, which are worth an average of $1200. However, since we are on the test network, these coins hold little actual value.

This area represents your wallet; click on the arrow as indicated to select the network. The selected network should be Sepolia because we are testing on the Sepolia network.

Select Sepolia Network

Make sure that "Show test networks" is enabled and select the Sepolia network.

Now, we move to where we will receive our ETHEREUM test coins!

Receive Test ETH

The information here is your wallet address on the blockchain. If you send real Ethereum to this address and select Ethereum Mainnet as the network, you will see your funds there. However, we will be receiving test Ethereum. After copying the address, go to the following site and request test coins:


Paste the previously copied address here. Make sure it's correct because only 0.5 Testnet ETHEREUM can be obtained daily. Verify that you are not a robot, click on "Send Me ETH," and if there are no errors on the site, you should see your testnet coins in MetaMask.

Acquiring Demo Coins
To obtain demo coins, we use a system called airdrop. Instructions for this are provided in the previous section.

Now, go to our demo site, and when prompted to connect MetaMask, accept the request.

Click "Next" to connect your wallet as a dApp on the web3 network. Accept the connection, and the confirmation screen should look like the one below:

Connect MetaMask

1: Your wallet address.
2: Your Sepolia ETH balance.
3: We are interested in this section, where you can claim airdrop coins, limited to 25 per wallet.
Due to network congestion, the site suggests a high transaction fee. Transaction fees are rewards distributed to users who mine on the blockchain. If the network is not busy, you can complete this transfer with very low fees. Proceed through the steps, and after importing the contract address, you will have successfully claimed 25 coins.

Token contract address: 0xd67B520872230d4C0bDd99c5f9cab411034b403f

Notes
This process can only be completed once per account.
If you need additional coins, refer to the airdrop section explained earlier.
